Traditional Ukrainian clothing has conquered the hearts of the worldj;s most fashionable people, thus making it popular beyond the traditional concept of it.
The reasons for such hype include a simplicity in form, a slender silhouette, a variety of symbols and ornamentation, and the rich colors used.
Traditional Ukrainian apparel j;¤ the roots of which trace back to the times of Kievan Rus j;¤ has many stylistic varieties.
Its look depends on the ethnographic region, even though a homemade shirt, made of homespun cloth, has always constituted the basis for both male and female wardrobes.
 The main feature of this shirt (vyshyvanka) is the embroidery on the neck, cuffs and hem.
