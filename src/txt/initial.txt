Vyshyvanka
Traditional Ukrainian clothing has conquered the hearts of the world's most fashionable people, thus making it popular beyond the traditional concept of it.
The reasons for such hype include a simplicity in form, a slender silhouette, a variety of symbols and ornamentation, and the rich colors used.
Traditional Ukrainian apparel - the roots of which trace back to the times of Kievan Rus - has many stylistic varieties.
Its look depends on the ethnographic region, even though a homemade shirt, made of homespun cloth, has always constituted the basis for both male and female wardrobes.
 The main feature of this shirt (vyshyvanka) is the embroidery on the neck, cuffs and hem.
 
Borshch
If you ask any Ukrainian to name a few traditional dishes, then this list will certainly include borshch. In Yonderbound's global rankings, borshch was defined as "soup made from meat, beetroot and everything that is in the refrigerator".
 That is because there are more than 70 recipes for red borshch. Locals have traditionally made it using kvass made from beet, diluted with water, and then added beet, cabbage, potatoes, onions and carrots. Modern hostesses have replaced beet kvass as a dressing for borshch with tomato paste. It came into use at the beginning of the twentieth century, when American tomatoes were no longer considered 'exotic' in Ukraine.

The classic version is made with pork, veal or chicken broth, and a reference for rich borshch is such "that your spoon would stand up in it"; However, the lean version is also common: with mushrooms or string beans. In some regions, fish is also used instead of meat. Moreover, in Zhytomyr Region, for example, you can try borshchcontaining dried fruit. In Ukraine, it is customary to serve such a dish with a spoon of sour cream and fragrant buns called 'pampushky', grated with garlic. Ukrainians love this dish so much that they even named a small town in Ternopil Region in honour of it. Now it hosts an annual borshch festival.
